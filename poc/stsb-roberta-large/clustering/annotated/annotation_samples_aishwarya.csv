He's a democrat that took advantage of a weak party. \n\nTo be clear, as a conservative, the reason I'm not voting for him isn't [only] because of his democratic policies. The biggest reason is he shouldn't be running a country. Can you imagine giving this guy a military and then telling him to go talk to Rouhani or even Putin?

You can still buy guns but maybe not certain guns.\n\nthat is literally preventing law abiding gun owners from owning guns.\n\n&gt;But other countries in Europe and Australia have those problems and they don't have nearly the kind of gun deaths that we do. \n\nEurope and Australia have better healthcare then us. They also have a stronger social safety net. \n\n&gt;But one country doesn't invalidate data from all the others.'\n\nJapan, Nepal, Belgium, Finland. All have a higher suicide rate yet way less guns.\n\n&gt;But everything you suggested are huge, complex, and nuance problems that might contribute to gun violence and suicide. A small percentage of mentally ill people are violent. The War on Drugs is a governmental policy that is way too big to get into and lack of education is fairly vague.\n\nIf you murder someone you are mentally ill. Plain and simple. The war on drugs drives gang violence and funny thing is, In that article about Chicago you posted. It says a large factor of Chicago's violence is gang related. Maybe i was right!\n\n&gt; The lack of down the board federal gun regulations is partially at fault here. Chicago is right next door to Indiana which has lax gun laws. So people go for a day trip to buy guns.\n\nSo if guns were banned people would just go to mexico to get guns? Ok, got it!\n\nEdit. I forgot to add the majority of gun deaths are caused by the mentally ill due to the fact if you are suicidal, you are mentally ill.\n

It is not just me.  I have worked around many officers (100's) who believe the system has wrecked the communities and families.

Most civilian deaths from the war have come from Assad.  In Aleppo, the great majority came from Assad and Russia, considering how heavily they bombed the city.\n\nOtherwise, US rules of engagement are very strict which allows for less civilian casualties.  Having vastly superior technology most likely also makes it easier to conduct surgical strikes.  Not to mention, using barrel bombs or cluster munitions (both tied to Russia/Assad) would be frowned upon anyway.\n\nAs for drone strikes?\n\nIt's probably the same.  Strict ROEs and superior technology makes it easier to avoid these civilian casualties.\n\nNow, the US government had a report (posted on CNN and such) regarding drone strikes which mentioned very little civilian deaths.  I, personally, am quite skeptical of those almost flawless numbers.  But I guarantee the truth is much, much closer to that report than it is from popular internet/college campus rhetoric.  Essentially, the ratio is pretty good in terms of avoiding civilians.\n\nAs pointed from GTFErinyes in his response to Bamont, there was a period around 2009-2010 that the Pakistani Air Force launched a massive air campaign which coincided with some drone strikes.  Unfortunately, civilians on the ground can't differentiate between an IED, suicide vest, drone strike, or fighter/bomber strike.  Likewise, pro-Taliban and anti-US sources will quickly pin the blame on the US to generate propaganda.  Thus, a lot of blame was pinned on drones.\n\nFactor in shoddy reporting from academics and reporters and you get the unfair stigma drone strikes have today.

Name: tweet_text, dtype: object",** \n\nThe only part of the VA law that goes against the federal ban is the exemptions to preserve the health of the mother.,"3194530    What are you talking about with Nebraska? They tried to implement a partial birth ban, but the Supreme Court ruled that any such ban that was not specific enough to refer only to the procedure you described, and did not include provisions for the mother's health was unconstitutional. (Stenberg v. Carhart) \n\nCongress, of course, immediately passed a law saying that a partial-birth abortion was *never* necessary for the health of the mother, and banned the procedure you mentioned.\n\nSo maybe remove Nebraska from your list of states begging to kill babies. \n\nAs for New York and California, it's largely the same deal, but without the presence of a state ban. These were cases that led to Gonzales v. Carhart, so existing case law was ""this procedure is not allowed to be ruled illegal unless there is a provision to ensure the mother's health."" The state courts ruled the federal ban was unconstitutional, since it has no provision for the mother's health. \n\nIs that really the same as California intentionally passing state laws that ran counter to against federal law? Maybe take New York and California off that list too. \n\nNone of those states ""resisted"" the federal ban, and no state and no act is exempt from the Supremecy Clause. So that's wrong too. \n\nEdit: Utah passed a law with an exemption for situations where the mother's life was in jeopardy. Does that count as ""resisting?"" Because I can't find anything else about Utah allowing partial-birth abortions, but they're *technically* more lenient than federal law. \n\nEdit 2: Michigan kept trying to pass new partial-birth and total abortion bans after they kept being ruled unconstitutional (even *after* Carhart v. Gonzales, which is honestly, impressive). They've since settled on \n\n&gt;Partial Birth Abortion: Unlawful except to save the life of a mother endangered by physical illness, physical injury, or physical disorder when no other medical procedure will suffice. \n\nAgain, more lenient than the federal law, but hardly ""resisting"" the way California was with medical marijuana. \n\nAre you *sure* you're alright with exemptions for mothers' health? Because you say you are, but the cases you bring up really make it sound like you aren't. **None** of the states I've looked into from your list enacted legislation against the federal law. The opposite, actually, for all except NY and CA. \n\nEdit 3: Alright, looked into VA. Surprise, surprise, another state ban, another court challenge. This one upheld. **No legislation resisting the federal ban.** \n\nThe only part of the VA law that goes against the federal ban is the exemptions to preserve the health of the mother. \n\n**Tl;dr, either you're misinformed, full of shit, or see states who have language written in to protect the health of mothers (actually, in most cases, just to keep mothers alive. Health problems that don't result in death wouldn't provide an exemption) as just as bad as states that don't want any restrictions on the procedure.**

Name: tweet_text, dtype: object",*\n\n&gt;*The Arizona Republic endorses Hillary Clinton for president.,"730766    Ground-Breaking &amp; Historic Endorsements/Non-Endorsements compiled:\n\n[**The Chicago Tribune endorses Johnson**](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-gary-johnson-president-endorsement-edit-1002-20160930-story.html) **-** ***2nd Non-Republican endorsement in 163 years***\n\n&gt;*The Republicans have nominated Donald Trump, a man not fit to be president of the United States. We first wrote on March 10 that we would not, could not, endorse him. And in the intervening six-plus months he has splendidly reinforced our verdict: Trump has gone out of his way to anger world leaders, giant swaths of the American public, and people of other lands who aspire to immigrate here legally. He has neither the character nor the prudent disposition for the job.*\n\n&gt;*He has ridden to the White House gate on the backs of Americans who believe they've been robbed of opportunity and respect. But inaugurating a bombastic and self-aggrandizing President Donald Trump isn't the cure.*\n\n&gt;*One party has two moderate Republicans — veteran governors who successfully led Democratic states — atop its ticket. Libertarians Gary Johnson of New Mexico and running mate William Weld of Massachusetts are agile, practical and, unlike the major-party candidates, experienced at managing governments. They offer an agenda that appeals not only to the Tribune's principles but to those of the many Americans who say they are socially tolerant but fiscally responsible.*\n\n&gt;*So the Chicago Tribune today endorses Libertarian Gary Johnson for president of the United States.*\n\n[**The Atlantic endorses Clinton**](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-case-for-hillary-clinton-and-against-donald-trump/501161/) **-** ***Third Presidential endorsement &amp; second non-Republican endorsement in 159 years***\n\n&gt;*We are impressed by many of the qualities of the Democratic Party’s nominee for president, even as we are exasperated by others, but we are mainly concerned with the Republican Party’s nominee, Donald J. Trump, who might be the most ostentatiously unqualified major-party candidate in the 227-year history of the American presidency.*\n\n&gt;*These concerns compel us, for the third time since the magazine’s founding, to endorse a candidate for president. Hillary Rodham Clinton has more than earned, through her service to the country as first lady, as a senator from New York, and as secretary of state, the right to be taken seriously as a White House contender. She has flaws (some legitimately troubling, some exaggerated by her opponents), but she is among the most prepared candidates ever to seek the presidency. We are confident that she understands the role of the United States in the world; we have no doubt that she will apply herself assiduously to the problems confronting this country; and she has demonstrated an aptitude for analysis and hard work.*\n\n&gt;*Donald Trump, on the other hand, has no record of public service and no qualifications for public office. His affect is that of an infomercial huckster; he traffics in conspiracy theories and racist invective; he is appallingly sexist; he is erratic, secretive, and xenophobic; he expresses admiration for authoritarian rulers, and evinces authoritarian tendencies himself. He is easily goaded, a poor quality for someone seeking control of America’s nuclear arsenal. He is an enemy of fact-based discourse; he is ignorant of, and indifferent to, the Constitution; he appears not to read.*\n\n&gt;*In its founding statement, The Atlantic promised that it would be “the organ of no party or clique,” and our interest here is not to advance the prospects of the Democratic Party, nor to damage those of the Republican Party. If Hillary Clinton were facing Mitt Romney, or John McCain, or George W. Bush, or, for that matter, any of the leading candidates Trump vanquished in the Republican primaries, we would not have contemplated making this endorsement. We believe in American democracy, in which individuals from various parties of different ideological stripes can advance their ideas and compete for the affection of voters. But Trump is not a man of ideas. He is a demagogue, a xenophobe, a sexist, a know-nothing, and a liar. He is spectacularly unfit for office, and voters—the statesmen and thinkers of the ballot box—should act in defense of American democracy and elect his opponent.*\n\n[**The San Diego Union-Tribune endorses Clinton**](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/the-conversation/sd-hillary-clinton-endorsement-for-president-20160929-story.html) **-** ***First Democrat endorsed in 148 years***\n\n&gt;*Trump is ""vengeful, dishonest and impulsive"". Terrible leaders can knock nations off course. Venezuela is falling apart because of the obstinance and delusions of Hugo Chávez and his successor. Argentina is finally coming out of the chaos created by Cristina Kirchner and several of her predecessors.*\n\n&gt;*Trump could be our Chávez, our Kirchner. We cannot take that risk.*\n\n&gt;*This paper has not endorsed a Democrat for president in its 148-year history. But we endorse Clinton.*\n\n[**The Detroit News endorses Johnson**](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/09/28/endorse-johnson-president/91254412/) **-** ***First Non-Republican endorsement in 143 years***\n\n&gt;*We abandon that long and estimable tradition this year for one reason: Donald J. Trump.*\n\n&gt;*Trump is not a conservative. Except, of course, of those who wrongly e­quate conservatism with racism, sexism and xenophobia. Trump has attracted support from too many of those who represent the worst of human nature.*\n\n&gt;*We have seen no hint that Trump has a guiding set of principles. He changes positions hour to hour.*\n\n&gt;*But the most worrisome thing about Trump is that he is willing to stir the populace by stoking their fears of sinister forces at work from within and without to tear down their traditions, values and families. He has found profit in dividing Americans from each other, and from the rest of the world.*\n\n&gt;*His sort of populism has led to some of history’s great tragedies.  Donald Trump is unprincipled, unstable and quite possibly dangerous. He can not be president.*\n\n[**The Harvard Republican Club opposes Trump**](https://www.facebook.com/HarvardGOP/posts/1190758900944693) **-** ***First non-endorsement of a Republican in 128 years***\n\n&gt;*Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses –from racist slander to misogynistic taunts– is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.*\n\n&gt;*If enacted, Donald Trump’s platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad.*\n\n&gt;*Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world.*\n\n&gt;*Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children.*\n\n&gt;*We call on our party’s elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man.*\n\n[**The Arizona Republic endorses Clinton**](http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/09/27/hillary-clinton-endorsement/91198668/) **-** ***First Democrat endorsed in 126 years***\n\n&gt;*Trump’s inability to control himself or be controlled by others represents a real threat to our national security. \nThe president commands our nuclear arsenal. Trump can’t command his own rhetoric.*\n\n&gt;*Were he to become president, his casual remarks — such as saying he wouldn’t defend NATO partners from invasion — could have devastating consequences.  In a global economy, he offers protectionism and a false promise to bring back jobs that no longer exist.*\n\n&gt;*Trump’s long history of objectifying women and his demeaning comments about women during the campaign are not just good-old-boy gaffes. They are evidence of deep character flaws. They are part of a pattern.*\n\n&gt;*Trump mocked a reporter’s physical handicap. Picked a fight with a Gold Star family. Insulted POWs. Suggested a Latino judge can’t be fair because of his heritage. Proposed banning Muslim immigration.*\n\n&gt;*Each of those comments show a stunning lack of human decency, empathy and respect. Taken together they reveal a candidate who doesn’t grasp our national ideals.*\n\n&gt;*The Arizona Republic endorses Hillary Clinton for president.*

The Internet and automation already runs our whole lives at this point whether we like it or not, and our leadership is absolutely clueless about technology and the ramification of it in the near future. ""I'll bring back jobs!""....no you won't. \n\nI guess overall it just points to the simple fact our own governance models, processes, and even the Constitution are hopelessly antiquated for the world we live in today. We're 200 years out of date.

Most civilian deaths from the war have come from Assad.  In Aleppo, the great majority came from Assad and Russia, considering how heavily they bombed the city.\n\nOtherwise, US rules of engagement are very strict which allows for less civilian casualties.  Having vastly superior technology most likely also makes it easier to conduct surgical strikes.  Not to mention, using barrel bombs or cluster munitions (both tied to Russia/Assad) would be frowned upon anyway.\n\nAs for drone strikes?\n\nIt's probably the same.  Strict ROEs and superior technology makes it easier to avoid these civilian casualties.\n\nNow, the US government had a report (posted on CNN and such) regarding drone strikes which mentioned very little civilian deaths.  I, personally, am quite skeptical of those almost flawless numbers.  But I guarantee the truth is much, much closer to that report than it is from popular internet/college campus rhetoric.  Essentially, the ratio is pretty good in terms of avoiding civilians.\n\nAs pointed from GTFErinyes in his response to Bamont, there was a period around 2009-2010 that the Pakistani Air Force launched a massive air campaign which coincided with some drone strikes.  Unfortunately, civilians on the ground can't differentiate between an IED, suicide vest, drone strike, or fighter/bomber strike.  Likewise, pro-Taliban and anti-US sources will quickly pin the blame on the US to generate propaganda.  Thus, a lot of blame was pinned on drones.\n\nFactor in shoddy reporting from academics and reporters and you get the unfair stigma drone strikes have today.

But sure, I could be Pathfinder and show the world what I can do.  \n\n**Do you have a name and surname that is not ripped straight out of existing Earth mythology or popular culture?**\n\nI don't know you so I won't share my elven birth name, but you call me Lucifer Rex. Even you humans should be able to pronounce that correctly. \n\n**Which nation did you grow up in? How did this nation influence you?**\n  \nI grew up here in the Shackles, even before the storm came and changed everything. Maybe it's an odd place for an elf but there is quite a lot us in this young city of Port Peril. You could say that I am part of the rough culture here, people will take advantage of you if you aren't one step ahead already.  \n\n**What do you look like? What are your wearing? How does this vary when you’re stalking through forests, sewers, deserts or in glittering cities?**\n\nI would describe myself as average physique, not short and fat like you. My skin and hair has adapted to this environment, so as you can see, my skin is quite dark while my hair is blond with a hint of green. You are probably just staring at my grey eyes and ears because they aren't as small as yours.  \n\nThe clothes I am wearing are the nicer looking ones in this area. We know fashion so don't argue. Even if I would adopt my clothes for the job, I wouldn't really stalk through the sewers, there are others that could do that for you. \n\n**What do you love? (Treasure and experience doesn’t count)**\n\nI do love the elven culture, art and craftsmanship. Our patron Findeladlara is right you know, there is nothing better than the elven art so Shelyn is wasting her time on new talents. \n\n**What do you hate? (Unclear and irritating darkness level rules don’t count)**\n\nGee... maybe those asshats that are keeping me here on this ship as a slave. You don't take away an elves freedom! It's driving me insane and I have to act all friendly to these bastards or else I will get beaten, whipped or even killed. But I will have my revenge, oh yes, by Calistria these men will suffer tenfold for what they have done. And then, I use their ship to fight the Cheliax or any other nation that threaten our freedom! \n\n**Which other Pathfinders (PCs) do you rely on for teamwork, survival and butt-kicking? Do you have a bro? a mentor? a father figure? maybe a rival?**\n\nRight now, it looks like I have to depend on these other slaves that they caught with me. Sure, they have been useless on the tasks given to them but I have seen what they can do. The cleric ripped the direrats to pieces with her dark energy, the little gnome created arcane armor in a flash and that strange pale woman has the most dominating presence. I need them to take over this ship.   \n  \nBrother? No, but a bastard half-sister somewhere. Mentor and father figure? Yeah sure, back in Port Peril. \n\n**How does your race influence your views? Are you a stereotype of a certain race? How are you different from most humans/elves/gnomes/orcs/tengu?**\n\nYou think I am a racist right? You probably think all elves are, even though you are the one asking about races. Let me tell you something about us elves - we aren't as stressed about life as you are since we don't grow old as fast as you do. We share the soul with our close ones and wasting a relationship on a short lived being like yourself is just tragic. You do not want to hurt your soul with sad memories like the Forlon and live hundreds of year depressed or insane by sorrow. \n\nHow are we different from orcs?! Are you trying to piss me off by comparing us to those black blooded monsters?! Go plow yourself! We are nothing like them. \n\n**What are you afraid of? Do you have any phobias or worries?**\n\nI want to show you what an elf can do in a human world, but I am adraid that I wont succeed. I am different and you don't like that, even though I will carry my knowledge and experience through many of your generations. \n\n**What is your most treasured possession?**\n\nA holy symbol of Findeladlara that my mother crafted for me and the elven carpenter tools from my father.

Name: tweet_text, dtype: object","If times are difficult, extremism, fundamentalism, and totalitarianism typically lift their ugly heads, in one form or another.","1012867    &gt;That's not actually the case. No more than any passage of the Bible can be taken as ""can't be changed, ever"". Generally interpretation of holy texts as literal and absolute is attributed to extremism (""extremists interpret the Quaran literally""), you're reversing that connection (""The Quaran is meant to be interpreted literally, resulting in extremism"").\n\nPerhaps it doesn't say it outright, but it is heavily implied that the Qu'ran was recited to Muhammed by Archangel Gabriel, and he wrote it down and it cannot be changed from what it is.\n\nPerhaps the problem is, rather, that denying the Qu'ran would basically be the same as denying that Muhammed is God's Prophet (with respect to whatever is being denied).\n\nWhatever the reasoning, the end result is the same - Qu'ran and Islamic doctrine in general is remarkably more resistant to change than a lot of other religions, because of these ""anti-tampering"" clauses sneaked into the doctrine itself.\n\nIn this sense, you are also right - literal interpretation of holy texts is connected to extremism, but the problem is that the currently dominant sects of Islam actually *are* much more extremist-like, conservative, and fundamentalist, than Islam was during the Islamic Golden Age for example.\n\nI *hope* that at some point, a reformation can occur which allows muslims to no longer blindly accept *everything* that Muhammed wrote in the Qu'ran - and yes, I know that there are undoubtedly already many muslims who *don't* accept everything in the Qu'ran, but this is exactly what I'm talking about - there is a cognitive dissonance between being a moderate muslim, and what the ""official"" doctrines of Islam are.\n\nBut as I wrote:\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, that basically means that Islam should stop being Islam, because the truth and perfection of Qu'ran [ie. ""There is no god but Allah, and Muhammed is his messenger"" which implies the divine and immutable nature of the Qu'ran] is one of the most important doctrines in Islam. However, this is necessary so that other changes could occur. **Maybe it would no longer be called Islam; maybe it would**, but even just this change would be rather unlikely [in the short term].\n\nSo my point here is that the predominant Islamic doctrine about Quran's immutability must change, before the Qu'ran can be changed or interpreted more liberally. In other words, Islam must change in this respect first to be able to change in other respects; whether this is accomplished by formation of something new, or changing the old, that is something I couldn't say.\n\nI agree that those of already fundamentalist leanings will be the ones that will be most willing to interpret the Qu'ran literally as their values are already the closest match to the values of Muhammed in his time, and just like with every religion, it turns out the God's values are always the same as the values of the people of that religion... (what a coincidence).\n\nAnd yes, the economical and social issues are the ones to concentrate on. If people are happy with their lives, they tend to be peaceful and content. If times are difficult, extremism, fundamentalism, and totalitarianism typically lift their ugly heads, in one form or another.

Name: tweet_text, dtype: object","While offshoring did result in a loss of manufacturing jobs, it corresponded with an increase in automation, which can't be rolled back.","2834127    I'll discuss the issues with you! We just haven't been doing it very much because Trump doesn't advocate policy like a normal nominee, and also refuses to clarify, explain, or admit he held most of the positions he held at any given point. \n\nHere goes!\n\nTrump's plan to build a wall will raise taxes. He failed to negotiate Mexicon paying when he met with the President, and has recently shifted to claiming America will build it, but get paid back by Mexico. I find that unlikely Mexico will do this, and believe a massive, high tech border wall that is gonna be very expensive, and not entirely successful, isn't worth the price tag. \n\n\nHis tax cuts will reduce most people's taxes by less than he'd cut his own. I am not a multi-millionaire and not a real estate developer, so I don't get the deductions he plans to add. Repealing the Gift/Estate tax is unnecessary and costly. The national debt would increase substantially under this plan without a corresponding cut in spending, which he has yet to identify. \n\nHe doesn't believe in climate change, so no action on that front. This was the hottest year on record, and claiming Global Warming is a Chinese hoax isn't a long term strategy. He'd also take us out of existing climate accords; which is a step in the wrong direction on this issue. \n\nHis trade policies won't create the jobs he thinks, and will cost most Americans money. While offshoring did result in a loss of manufacturing jobs, it corresponded with an increase in automation, which can't be rolled back. Leaving the WTO is a shitty idea. \n\nHis secret plan to destroy ISIS seems to amounts to ""torture their families"" and ""don't tell them when we're going to attack"". The first part is objectively a war crime, the second is irrelevant.

The population, thank god, doesn't get to decide. The people elected by them do. They're elected because people trust their judgement.\n\nRepresentative democracy is where people elect representatives to govern on their behalf.  Democracy in itself doesn't require representatives, or any specific kind of system, and some forms of democracy give more or less power to individual voters...\n\nAnd when it comes to constitutional questions, as in where sovereignty lies, how a country is governed, democratic accountability is pretty important. In much the same way that annexing a territory that doesn't want you to is abhorrent, forcing your population to be subsumed into a larger country without their consent, or indeed actively against their will is simply not a recipe for anything other than disaster.\n\n&gt;You can't expect the general population to have a wide knowledge of the geopolitical and economical situation of Europe, their single countries, and the world. And without that information they cannot make a choice that would benefit them, they can only make a gut decision based on instinct and what the media want them to think.\n\nSo.. Should we cancel all elections? How can people, with their lack of understanding, know who would better represent them, or which party would better be able to implement policies that benefit them?\n\nThis isn't a question about specific policy implementations, or economic policies, it isn't a question about treaties or geopolitics, it is a question as fundamental as it gets, it's about who governs you. It is absolutely a question that can be asked and answered by a population, and frankly it is one that has much more to do with what people want and believe in than what might benefit them most...\n\nThe EU can't federalise without consent, it would lead to massive disunity and disruption and it would lack all legitimacy. Talking about the difference between representative democracy and direct democracy, or the odd referendum doesn't change that...

This is while the occupiers of Palestine were trying to use the World Police to Iraq, Iran.\n\nSo Russia steped in to support Iran on the UN stage. (The UN stage is important.) This effectively publically drew lines, the UK(Canada, Australia etc..), US &amp; Isreal vs Iran, Russia, &amp; China. \n\nThen Lybia decides to move off of the petrol Dollar, and make its own Gold Backed Petro currency. This would have killed the Petro Dollar, so the World Police, Police the World and protect the Banks...Ghadaffi(Libya) gets Sadam'd(Iraq).\n\nAgain...the Occupiers of Palestine attempt to Iraq, Iran. Again... Russia steps in, and nominates Palestine as a State recognized by the UN. This deligitmizes many claims by the Occupiers of Palestine, and many of their Zionist supporters.\n\nEnter Syria... The people get outside support to go against their own gov't. Russia says its the US arming terrorist, the US says we're dropping democracy...both accuse eachother of Chemical Warfare. \n\nThe UN comes in, traces the Chem to a American Company... Then Gaza... Continues. Basically a huge spike in Child deaths and other crazyness brings the worlds attention to the Occupiers of Palestine and the People of Palestine. This is also around the time of the Missing downed planes, which the Worlds Police Blames on Russia. During this time the Left of Syria is fighting the Right of Syria. Russia backs the govt of Syria(to protect it's port), while the West backed forces backs the Left....it just so happens these people are also the same people the ""West"" has been fighting in Iraq and Lybia. \n\nThis is around the time you heard of all the US military Aid in Iraq and other Middle Eastern States, being taken by ISIS. \n\nSo.... Now to the peace agreement. Both the US and Russia agree to a ceasefire (Syria). US backed rebels break ceasefire and attack. Russia holds firm and documents it, hands this info to the UN for investagation. US accuses Russia of basically doing what the US did. Russia issues a statement saying next time fuck taking pictures we will shoot, US issues statement we're ready when you are.\n\nIt's important to note the name changes IS, ISIS, &amp; ISIL...and who uses them. For a long time the US has been looking for reasons to invade Syria. You'll notice many US politicans still say ISIL... Anyways... \n\nSo... Russia has been playing the chess game very carefully, utilizing the UN to show its not being the aggressor... Enter WikiLeaks. With Killery emails being exposed the US govt has taken the stance that she(the US) was hacked by Russia, and Russia is using ""made-up"" emails to make the US look bad (like the world police).\n\nSo lt;rd\n\nWe are already in WW3, the West just hasnt felt it outside of anxiety and Panic attacks. Syria is the latest piece of land to be fought over to Isolate Iran to protect the Occupiers of Palestine. \n

Name: tweet_text, dtype: object",But we endorse Clinton.,"730766    Ground-Breaking &amp; Historic Endorsements/Non-Endorsements compiled:\n\n[**The Chicago Tribune endorses Johnson**](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-gary-johnson-president-endorsement-edit-1002-20160930-story.html) **-** ***2nd Non-Republican endorsement in 163 years***\n\n&gt;*The Republicans have nominated Donald Trump, a man not fit to be president of the United States. We first wrote on March 10 that we would not, could not, endorse him. And in the intervening six-plus months he has splendidly reinforced our verdict: Trump has gone out of his way to anger world leaders, giant swaths of the American public, and people of other lands who aspire to immigrate here legally. He has neither the character nor the prudent disposition for the job.*\n\n&gt;*He has ridden to the White House gate on the backs of Americans who believe they've been robbed of opportunity and respect. But inaugurating a bombastic and self-aggrandizing President Donald Trump isn't the cure.*\n\n&gt;*One party has two moderate Republicans — veteran governors who successfully led Democratic states — atop its ticket. Libertarians Gary Johnson of New Mexico and running mate William Weld of Massachusetts are agile, practical and, unlike the major-party candidates, experienced at managing governments. They offer an agenda that appeals not only to the Tribune's principles but to those of the many Americans who say they are socially tolerant but fiscally responsible.*\n\n&gt;*So the Chicago Tribune today endorses Libertarian Gary Johnson for president of the United States.*\n\n[**The Atlantic endorses Clinton**](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-case-for-hillary-clinton-and-against-donald-trump/501161/) **-** ***Third Presidential endorsement &amp; second non-Republican endorsement in 159 years***\n\n&gt;*We are impressed by many of the qualities of the Democratic Party’s nominee for president, even as we are exasperated by others, but we are mainly concerned with the Republican Party’s nominee, Donald J. Trump, who might be the most ostentatiously unqualified major-party candidate in the 227-year history of the American presidency.*\n\n&gt;*These concerns compel us, for the third time since the magazine’s founding, to endorse a candidate for president. Hillary Rodham Clinton has more than earned, through her service to the country as first lady, as a senator from New York, and as secretary of state, the right to be taken seriously as a White House contender. She has flaws (some legitimately troubling, some exaggerated by her opponents), but she is among the most prepared candidates ever to seek the presidency. We are confident that she understands the role of the United States in the world; we have no doubt that she will apply herself assiduously to the problems confronting this country; and she has demonstrated an aptitude for analysis and hard work.*\n\n&gt;*Donald Trump, on the other hand, has no record of public service and no qualifications for public office. His affect is that of an infomercial huckster; he traffics in conspiracy theories and racist invective; he is appallingly sexist; he is erratic, secretive, and xenophobic; he expresses admiration for authoritarian rulers, and evinces authoritarian tendencies himself. He is easily goaded, a poor quality for someone seeking control of America’s nuclear arsenal. He is an enemy of fact-based discourse; he is ignorant of, and indifferent to, the Constitution; he appears not to read.*\n\n&gt;*In its founding statement, The Atlantic promised that it would be “the organ of no party or clique,” and our interest here is not to advance the prospects of the Democratic Party, nor to damage those of the Republican Party. If Hillary Clinton were facing Mitt Romney, or John McCain, or George W. Bush, or, for that matter, any of the leading candidates Trump vanquished in the Republican primaries, we would not have contemplated making this endorsement. We believe in American democracy, in which individuals from various parties of different ideological stripes can advance their ideas and compete for the affection of voters. But Trump is not a man of ideas. He is a demagogue, a xenophobe, a sexist, a know-nothing, and a liar. He is spectacularly unfit for office, and voters—the statesmen and thinkers of the ballot box—should act in defense of American democracy and elect his opponent.*\n\n[**The San Diego Union-Tribune endorses Clinton**](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/the-conversation/sd-hillary-clinton-endorsement-for-president-20160929-story.html) **-** ***First Democrat endorsed in 148 years***\n\n&gt;*Trump is ""vengeful, dishonest and impulsive"". Terrible leaders can knock nations off course. Venezuela is falling apart because of the obstinance and delusions of Hugo Chávez and his successor. Argentina is finally coming out of the chaos created by Cristina Kirchner and several of her predecessors.*\n\n&gt;*Trump could be our Chávez, our Kirchner. We cannot take that risk.*\n\n&gt;*This paper has not endorsed a Democrat for president in its 148-year history. But we endorse Clinton.*\n\n[**The Detroit News endorses Johnson**](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/09/28/endorse-johnson-president/91254412/) **-** ***First Non-Republican endorsement in 143 years***\n\n&gt;*We abandon that long and estimable tradition this year for one reason: Donald J. Trump.*\n\n&gt;*Trump is not a conservative. Except, of course, of those who wrongly e­quate conservatism with racism, sexism and xenophobia. Trump has attracted support from too many of those who represent the worst of human nature.*\n\n&gt;*We have seen no hint that Trump has a guiding set of principles. He changes positions hour to hour.*\n\n&gt;*But the most worrisome thing about Trump is that he is willing to stir the populace by stoking their fears of sinister forces at work from within and without to tear down their traditions, values and families. He has found profit in dividing Americans from each other, and from the rest of the world.*\n\n&gt;*His sort of populism has led to some of history’s great tragedies.  Donald Trump is unprincipled, unstable and quite possibly dangerous. He can not be president.*\n\n[**The Harvard Republican Club opposes Trump**](https://www.facebook.com/HarvardGOP/posts/1190758900944693) **-** ***First non-endorsement of a Republican in 128 years***\n\n&gt;*Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses –from racist slander to misogynistic taunts– is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.*\n\n&gt;*If enacted, Donald Trump’s platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad.*\n\n&gt;*Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world.*\n\n&gt;*Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children.*\n\n&gt;*We call on our party’s elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man.*\n\n[**The Arizona Republic endorses Clinton**](http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/09/27/hillary-clinton-endorsement/91198668/) **-** ***First Democrat endorsed in 126 years***\n\n&gt;*Trump’s inability to control himself or be controlled by others represents a real threat to our national security. \nThe president commands our nuclear arsenal. Trump can’t command his own rhetoric.*\n\n&gt;*Were he to become president, his casual remarks — such as saying he wouldn’t defend NATO partners from invasion — could have devastating consequences.  In a global economy, he offers protectionism and a false promise to bring back jobs that no longer exist.*\n\n&gt;*Trump’s long history of objectifying women and his demeaning comments about women during the campaign are not just good-old-boy gaffes. They are evidence of deep character flaws. They are part of a pattern.*\n\n&gt;*Trump mocked a reporter’s physical handicap. Picked a fight with a Gold Star family. Insulted POWs. Suggested a Latino judge can’t be fair because of his heritage. Proposed banning Muslim immigration.*\n\n&gt;*Each of those comments show a stunning lack of human decency, empathy and respect. Taken together they reveal a candidate who doesn’t grasp our national ideals.*\n\n&gt;*The Arizona Republic endorses Hillary Clinton for president.*

It's incredibly hard to oust an incumbent, especially in the primary. Most likely, we will have to wait until 2024.

Name: tweet_text, dtype: object","In future talks, the UK will have to decide if it wants to remain part of the single market.","1458983    Let us face facts: the European project is in trouble. With the growing threat of terrorism, the refugee crisis, lacklustre economic growth and unemployment, the turmoil in Europe is unprecedented.\n\n\nAdded to these, the Brexit vote deeply questioned the very meaning of Europe. In future talks, the UK will have to decide if it wants to remain part of the single market. If so, it will have to continue to guarantee the free movement of goods, capital, services and people.\n\nThe other 27 member states of the EU have two options (this was the subject of my debate with Jean-Claude Juncker at the Jacques Delors Institute last week): either we give up and leave the European project to a slow but certain death, or we transform the EU. This is the only way forward. But we cannot transform Europe if we do not first change our state of mind.\n\nEuropeans tend to shy away from patriotism — from national patriotism, for obvious historical reasons, but also from European patriotism: there is popular mistrust, a feeling that the EU infringes upon each member state’s sovereign power. We need better to assert our European identity, based on shared values of freedom, tolerance, peace and equality, including between men and women, on a shared civilisation and on culture, and based on the notion that we have a responsibility extending far beyond our own borders. I strongly believe there is room for a European patriotism that does not negate national ones but reinforces them.\n\nReasserting our European identity also means coming to terms with the fact that there are borders — that Europe starts and stops somewhere.\n\nToo often the EU has appeared to be preoccupied with unnecessary regulation. Transforming Europe also means that member states must henceforth focus on the essentials, primarily defence and security — in Europe, of course, but also in the neighbouring region of the Middle East. The French army is already doing more than its fair share: it cannot remain the de facto European army forever. France expects Europe to implement a common security strategy, with fully operational border guards and an electronic system for travel authorisation of the kind already operated by the US. The time for innocence is gone.\n\nFinally, transforming Europe means making a clear choice to foster growth that does not only depend on the European Central Bank’s monetary policy. Europe must finance new projects and invest in digital and environmental innovation more than it does already. These sectors must be enabled to grow and to face competition from countries that have no scruples about protecting their own industries. The time for naivety is over.\n\nFor this reason, the negotiations over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership cannot carry on as they have been. If the EU is to grant market access to American companies, there has to be reciprocity. Europe is the largest trading power and will not back down. An agreement between the US and EU would of course be a great opportunity. But it must be balanced and benefit both sides. An appropriately balanced deal with Canada is imminent.\n\nPro-growth policy should also include putting an end to abuse of the rules on “posted workers”, which currently allow companies to send employees temporarily to other member states. Posted worker status cannot be used as an excuse to pay people less or deprive them of their employment rights.\n\nThe European market must not be a social jungle, where people are set against one another. Nor can it be a tax jungle. It is unacceptable for multi­national companies to do everything in their power to avoid paying tax in the countries in which they make profits. The recent ruling of the European Commission on Apple’s tax affairs was courageous and welcome, therefore. At the same time, member states must progress towards common European tax rates. If not all 27 countries are ready to do so, then we must move forward with those that are.\n\nThese are the proposals France has put forward to transform Europe. It is now up to the EU to act on them quickly. Member states compete with large, developed and emerging nations. A strong Europe is essential if they want to carry weight on the world stage.\n\nWe cannot build a “United States of Europe”— each country has its own history, language and culture. But we can construct a sovereign Europe, a federation of nation states, strong and unashamed. We will not be the generation that buries the European project. We owe it to our young, who, for the most part, remain deeply attached to the European project. So are we.

473,"11673    These to pigs should be executed 
Name: tweet_text, dtype: object",Every once in a while we kill humans in order to prevent more humans from being killed.,"731173    The basic moral code for a lay Buddist is the Five Precepts.\n\nFirst, no killing.  This doesn't mean, ""It's only okay to kill certain things.""  It means that even if you kill an ant, what you're doing is in some sense bad, even if it's unavoidable.  It can be really bad if you take pleasure in killing, even if it's just killing bugs.  This precept doesn't discriminate in that way.  Yeah, sometimes we kill bugs to prevent the spread of disease.  Sometimes we kill pigs in order to eat them.  Every once in a while we kill humans in order to prevent more humans from being killed.  But this is always bad.\n\nSecond, don't steal.  More than just a rule about taking stuff, this is a rule about how you value yourself relative to others.  When you take something from someone, you're declaring that you're more important and your happiness matters more.  You ignore the fact that you victimize the other person and make her fear for her safety and wellbeing.\n\nThird, avoid sexual misconduct.  This is one that trips up a lot of people, because it isn't just a prescription to avoid assault.  Adultery is forbidden.  Promiscuity is bad.  You're only supposed to be intimate as an expression of love and commitment (and this means a *permanent* bond, not a temporary ""I'll marry you until I get bored or the feeling goes away, and then I'll find someone else"" sort of ""commitment"").  Sexual desire is *not* love, and acts motivated solely by this are *always* harmful to oneself and others.  Some schools of Buddhist thought take this even further, saying that it's only for procreation.  The reasoning is a bit different from the Catholic reasoning on the subject, though.\n\nFurthermore, this one requires mindfulness and taking others into account.  Staying committed to your partner isn't a formula for maximizing your own short-term happiness.  It's about thinking long-term, helping *both* of you feel secure (if a simple change in emotion over a short period can lead to upending your entire life, how can you ever feel safe or feel like a family?), and helping establish this sort of security as the standard so others can lead more comfortable lives, as well.\n\nIn that way, this is a lot like the first two precepts.  It's a rule to follow, but it's not *just* a rule.  It's a mindset that requires putting yourself and others into perspective and holding others as just as valuable as you are.\n\nThe fourth is to avoid lying.  There are obvious reasons for this and less obvious reasons.  Obviously, when you lie, you're directly harming others, but you're also doing less direct harm when you hold others as less valuable, and you hold truth as less valuable, too, which damages relationships and damages everyone's ability to have a coherent picture of the world.  Lies are often used for manipulation, often in violation of other precepts.\n\nThe fifth is not to drink alcohol.  Yes, really.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for this.  The most obvious is that alcohol leads to violating other precepts.  There is a famous parable about a monk walking down the road only to find it blocked by a woman holding a dog and a jug of booze.  She tells him she'll let him pass if he either kills the dog, sleeps with her, or drinks the alcohol.  The monk reasons that the alcohol is the least bad of the three things, so he drinks it.  Then, while drunk, he kills the dog and sleeps with her.\n\nThis story illustrates that alcohol leads to other mistakes, and thus it's a trap to think of it as innocent.  Some argue that a little alcohol is harmless, but that, too, is a trap.  If you train your mind to seek happiness in alcohol, maybe you'll have too much someday.  Maybe you're the type of person who gets addicted.\n\nEven if not, alcohol acts directly against one of the main goals of Buddhist life, which is to be awakened and mindful.  It clouds your mind, in some sense taking away a little bit of your life and your humanity.  Even if alcohol doesn't lead to violating other moral rules, it still gets in the way of the ""prime directive"" of Buddhism.  (Note: this clearly applies to other intoxicants, as well, so Buddhist potheads are harming their own practice, too.)\n\n**But there's more to it than that!**\n\nWe're not just taking a vow to avoid misconduct.  As lay Buddhists, we vow to ""save all things.""  This means actively engaging in positive conduct.  We seek to cultivate merit to go down the path to buddhahood in order to alleviate suffering of all sentient beings.\n\nSo it's not enough just to avoid killing.  We need to protect life.  When you see a big, scary spider in your room, take it outside.  Don't squish the poor thing.  And as someone vowing to protect life, you *do* have an obligation to attempt to live in an environmentally friendly way.  Limit your carbon footprint.  Try not to contribute to climate change.  Don't participate in harming endangered species.  That sort of thing.\n\nRefraining from stealing is good.  Actively giving to and serving others is better.  Even if you come by your wealth honestly, you're still valuing yourself more than others if you don't give to charity.\n\nRefraining from sexual misconduct is good, but cultivating a happy family life is better!  Honor your parents.  Raise your kids well.  Treat your spouse's happiness as a higher priority than your own, and take time to serve around the house without complaining.  (Complaining builds resentment and poisons the mind!)  If you're single, don't give in to lust.  Don't cloud your mind with filthy humor.  Don't support entertainment that degrades women.\n\nRefraining from lying is important.  Actively being honest and promoting words that heal rather than hurt is even better.  Don't use honesty as a club for beating people.  Use your words wisely, and learn to listen more than you talk, because listening to others places more value on them.\n\nRefraining from alcohol is good.  Practicing mindfulness is better.  You're wasting your sobriety if you deaden your mind with too much waste, too much entertainment, or too many distractions.  Seek to use your mind in a positive way to make the world a better place.\n\nThis isn't to say that you have to push yourself *all the time* to be perfect, because that leads to burnout anyway.\n\nBut whatever we are doing, we should be mindful.  One of the first things I learned from Thích Nhất Hạnh, besides the basics of meditation, is how, whatever I am doing, I should put my mind on that and do it as well as I can.  Am I filling a tub with water?  I should be mindful of that, and I should be the best I can at filling the tub with water.  Am I feeding my cats?  I should do that in a way that makes me as good a Buddhist as I can be while feeding my cats.\n\nLaziness, physical and mental, whether cutting corners or ignoring consequences, leads to suffering for ourselves and for others.\n\nThis is why Thích Nhất Hạnh words the Five Precepts in positive, ""do this"" form, rather than as a list of things to avoid.  His ""Five Mindfulness Trainings"" push us actively to be better.\n\nThis perspective also pushes the mental side of things.  We keep in mind that body and mind are one, so we don't pollute our mind with harmful ideas any more than we would pollute our bodies by acting on the ideas.  For instance, we don't let our minds dwell on violence or enjoy suffering, even if the violence and suffering are fictional.\n\nA Buddhist moral code is actually pretty strict and requires a lot more attention than.\n\nI guess these rules are ""guidelines"" more than rules in two senses, though.  First, there's the fact that they aren't comprehensive, but rather they're the expression of underlying principles that need to be followed when new situations arise even if there isn't already a rule governing that situation.  For example, a Buddhist two hundred years ago wouldn't have known about climate change.  We do know now, so we're obligated to fight against it because of how much suffering it is causing and will cause.  Buddhist morality isn't just a set of guidelines as in, ""Well, I'll follow this and that but not this.""  Obviously, we'll all stumble at times and make mistakes, but the rules work as a sort of starting place.\n\nSecond, though, they're guidelines in that no one is forcing anyone to be Buddhist.  If you don't want to follow the Five Precepts, or if you just simply don't see the value in doing so, then you're just not Buddhist.  Or you're following your own religion that is sort of based on Buddhism but isn't really Buddhist.\n\nThere's a somewhat facile argument that uses the old saying, ""If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.""  That argument holds that we should all reinvent the religion however we see fit, but this gives an overly broad scope to the old saying.  It's destructive rather than constructive.  You're supposed to seek out new ways to follow the path laid out for us, not to tear down everything that has been built and arrogantly assume we can all do better than the Buddha did.  Or if we do, then we shouldn't give it the same name, because we've built something completely different.

I try to find non-biased news sources, &amp; I'm not very familiar with the Daily Beast (I don't know if they lean right or left), but this is a good article explaining some details. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/30/the-billionaire-pedophile-who-could-bring-down-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton.html yes, Bill Clinton flew on his plane as well, but I think it's pretty clear Epstein is a star fucker. \nIf you trust Snopes (I do), there's this too: http://www.snopes.com/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/ \nMy mom is a far-right conservative, so she has this whole theory that Snopes is run by left-wing liberals, but I researched that &amp; the couple that runs it seems pretty neutral, especially since the wife is Canadian. \nAnd there's the whole thing Ivana wrote in her book about how Trump ripped out her hair &amp; raped her in a fit of rage over her referring him to some hair-transplant doctor who botched the job. Yes, she later said he didn't ""rape"" her, but the fact is he still physically assaulted her (&amp; honestly, he probably did rape her. \nIf it was one person accusing him of rape, that's one thing. But there's many women, and he actually still (as in, last week), speaks negatively towards the appearances of women-we really are seeing a pattern of a complete misogynist. My favorite comments are the things he said about being the owner of Miss USA on Howard Stern's show http://countercurrentnews.com/2016/10/trump-boasted-of-owning-miss-usa-pageant-so-he-could-watch-contestants-backstage/ \nIt comes down to this-he's either a big, fat liar, just speaking out his ass with his ""locker room talk"", or he's mad that he's said these things &amp; there's actual women who say ""yes, he did this shit to me, just like he says he does.""

I'm not scared of nuclear war under her, I'm not scared of being homeless or jobless under her. She's handled everything with grace &amp; dignity (I would be losing my shit if I were her, &amp; I can handle pressure well.) \nI am terrified of a Trump presidency.

Name: tweet_text, dtype: object","\n\nFWIW, I was a Bernie supporter.","3076405    I've heard about this for several years, before Trump was even running. I try to find non-biased news sources, &amp; I'm not very familiar with the Daily Beast (I don't know if they lean right or left), but this is a good article explaining some details. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/30/the-billionaire-pedophile-who-could-bring-down-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton.html yes, Bill Clinton flew on his plane as well, but I think it's pretty clear Epstein is a star fucker. \nIf you trust Snopes (I do), there's this too: http://www.snopes.com/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/ \nMy mom is a far-right conservative, so she has this whole theory that Snopes is run by left-wing liberals, but I researched that &amp; the couple that runs it seems pretty neutral, especially since the wife is Canadian. \nAnd there's the whole thing Ivana wrote in her book about how Trump ripped out her hair &amp; raped her in a fit of rage over her referring him to some hair-transplant doctor who botched the job. Yes, she later said he didn't ""rape"" her, but the fact is he still physically assaulted her (&amp; honestly, he probably did rape her. \nIf it was one person accusing him of rape, that's one thing. But there's many women, and he actually still (as in, last week), speaks negatively towards the appearances of women-we really are seeing a pattern of a complete misogynist. My favorite comments are the things he said about being the owner of Miss USA on Howard Stern's show http://countercurrentnews.com/2016/10/trump-boasted-of-owning-miss-usa-pageant-so-he-could-watch-contestants-backstage/ \nIt comes down to this-he's either a big, fat liar, just speaking out his ass with his ""locker room talk"", or he's mad that he's said these things &amp; there's actual women who say ""yes, he did this shit to me, just like he says he does."" So at this point, it doesn't even matter if they're lies or the truth, because it's all just really bad either way. \n\nFWIW, I was a Bernie supporter. He wasn't my perfect candidate, but now I'm 100% committed to Hillary, because she's had incredibly difficult jobs that she did well (protecting Americans on US soil is important to me.) I don't think she lied about Benghazi, I don't think the email scandal is a big deal, I think we will be as safe as we can be under her, I think we will prosper under her, I don't think she's got some nefarious scheme to undermine democracy, I think she genuinely wants to help the middle &amp; lower classes, I'm ok with the establishment carrying on, business as usual. I'm not scared of nuclear war under her, I'm not scared of being homeless or jobless under her. She's handled everything with grace &amp; dignity (I would be losing my shit if I were her, &amp; I can handle pressure well.) \nI am terrified of a Trump presidency. I'm scared for my safety as a woman, as an American, I'm scared I will lose my job (he's promised to shut down the legal marijuana industry, that I make a great living in), I'm scared for our military (he has zero respect for veterans), I'm scared of who he'll try to get appointed to the Supreme Court, I'm scared to lose my healthcare that I'm finally able to afford &amp; use, I'm scared how high my taxes will go.

This is while the occupiers of Palestine were trying to use the World Police to Iraq, Iran.\n\nSo Russia steped in to support Iran on the UN stage. (The UN stage is important.) This effectively publically drew lines, the UK(Canada, Australia etc..), US &amp; Isreal vs Iran, Russia, &amp; China. \n\nThen Lybia decides to move off of the petrol Dollar, and make its own Gold Backed Petro currency. This would have killed the Petro Dollar, so the World Police, Police the World and protect the Banks...Ghadaffi(Libya) gets Sadam'd(Iraq).\n\nAgain...the Occupiers of Palestine attempt to Iraq, Iran. Again... Russia steps in, and nominates Palestine as a State recognized by the UN. This deligitmizes many claims by the Occupiers of Palestine, and many of their Zionist supporters.\n\nEnter Syria... The people get outside support to go against their own gov't. Russia says its the US arming terrorist, the US says we're dropping democracy...both accuse eachother of Chemical Warfare. \n\nThe UN comes in, traces the Chem to a American Company... Then Gaza... Continues. Basically a huge spike in Child deaths and other crazyness brings the worlds attention to the Occupiers of Palestine and the People of Palestine. This is also around the time of the Missing downed planes, which the Worlds Police Blames on Russia. During this time the Left of Syria is fighting the Right of Syria. Russia backs the govt of Syria(to protect it's port), while the West backed forces backs the Left....it just so happens these people are also the same people the ""West"" has been fighting in Iraq and Lybia. \n\nThis is around the time you heard of all the US military Aid in Iraq and other Middle Eastern States, being taken by ISIS. \n\nSo.... Now to the peace agreement. Both the US and Russia agree to a ceasefire (Syria). US backed rebels break ceasefire and attack. Russia holds firm and documents it, hands this info to the UN for investagation. US accuses Russia of basically doing what the US did. Russia issues a statement saying next time fuck taking pictures we will shoot, US issues statement we're ready when you are.\n\nIt's important to note the name changes IS, ISIS, &amp; ISIL...and who uses them. For a long time the US has been looking for reasons to invade Syria. You'll notice many US politicans still say ISIL... Anyways... \n\nSo... Russia has been playing the chess game very carefully, utilizing the UN to show its not being the aggressor... Enter WikiLeaks. With Killery emails being exposed the US govt has taken the stance that she(the US) was hacked by Russia, and Russia is using ""made-up"" emails to make the US look bad (like the world police).\n\nSo lt;rd\n\nWe are already in WW3, the West just hasnt felt it outside of anxiety and Panic attacks. Syria is the latest piece of land to be fought over to Isolate Iran to protect the Occupiers of Palestine. \n

My idea of ""party"" games were ones that are easy to get into and illicit vocal responses (laughter/trashtalking/cheering), which is why some obvious co-op choices, like Left 4 Dead, are missing here.  \n\n \n* Crawl - 4 local. A unique slice of 1vs3 local co-op/vs fun. 1 person is the human, whichever monster kills him becomes the next human. There is equipment, monster evolving, and boss fights.  \n* Angry Arrows - 4 local. Top down archery with multiple vs/co-op modes including campaign. 1 shot kills makes this a hectic mix of wind ups/angles/cooldowns to juggle.  \n* Paperbound - 4 local. Arena fighting game with a neat art style, a twisty gravity mechanic that replaces jumping (VVVVVV style). Also: neat cameos from other indie games.\n* Pix the Cat 4 local. Pacman style arcade game that is twitchy and intense.  \n* Straima 4 local. Arcade platforming with different gameplay modes and modifiers. It is trippy and challenging  \n* Towerfall Ascension - 4 local arena style deathmatch. Expansion gives you a 4p campaign, base game has a 2p co-op campaign  \n* Fighties - 4 online/local, platformy deathmatch. The characters are interesting and simple: everyone has 2 unique attacks and they take community suggestions for characters. It's got simple and fun down to pat  \n* Brawlhalla - 4 local online A smash bros style deathmatch.   \n* Octodad - 4 local. One of those games where it's super difficult to control your character.  \n* 1001 Spikes - 4 local. It's a hard platformer with combat and boss battles. There is also a 2 player campaign that is separate from the 4 player, and there is a deathmatch for 4. Both of these require unlocking through single player progress. Cameos galore.  \n* A Fistful of Gun - 9 local/online. Chaotic and zany is the best description. it's a top \ndown shooter with slick style and a unique premise: not only do characters play differently, they also have different control schemes. Seriously, great western style.  \n* Broforce - 4 local/online . The local-only deathmatch is a ton of fun with some neat stages, fast gameplay, and a handful of Bros to choose form at a time. The campaign is local/online. If you want a taste of Broforce for free check out Expendabros as it is a polished bit of fun.    \n* Hammerwatch - 4 local/online, closest thing to Gauntlet out there (playful jab at recent Gauntlet entry, though I hear updates have made it better). Some RPG elements, secrets, challenge, and longevity.  \n* Risk of Rain - 4 local/online, light platforming action game with rogue elements. Lots of items/unlocks. I like the style (sci-fi, pixels, crazy small heroes) and music. One of my SO's favorites   \n* Spelunky - 4 local. Platformer with rogue elements. Most fun we had with this was just killing each other in campaign.   \n* Jamestown - 4 local bullet hell with an interesting setting and a great soundtrack. Also: multiple set-up options for controllers, e.g. 3 mouses and a keyboard.   \n* Speedrunners - 4 local/online Kind of like side scrolling/platforming Mario Kart   \n* Sonic Allstars Racing Transformed - 4 player local/online   \n*   Bloody Trapland 4 local/online platforming. It's pretty tough but can be fun.   \n\n\nThis is just a Repost of /u/wiesler  l[list](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/3y3ot1/steam_winter_sale_2015_day_3/cya7vul/?context=3) made 10 month ago.

That's why he is wanting to discuss which oversamples to use. It's as though Jill Stein went to a deeply conservative area of Kentucky to poll the demo of that area. Clearly that would be a waste of money and resources instead of focusing on areas that would be more receptive to her message which would maximize her efforts. \n\nSo let's say the Clinton campaign wants to run ads targeted to get her base excited. But first they want to run internal opinion polls to find out what type of message would resonate with her voters to get them fired up. In order to maximize the effectiveness, they would want to go and oversample the key demos that would be most likely part of her base, because they are the ones to being targeted by the media ads. Since a lot of her support comes from minorities, having a decreased MoE is vital to maximizing the validity of the data.\n\nRegarding the video and PM, I'll have to wait until I get home from work to be able to review it, but I'll try and get a response to you tonight.

I've been so eager and excited to vote for Donald Trump for what seems like such a long time since then but sadly my vote is being stolen from me.  I've been battling to get my Absentee Ballot. They tell me they've mailed it, I wait, don't receive it, report it and request another, wait, don't receive it, etc... and time is quickly running out. I'm not going to stop trying.  My husband and I continue to contact every buck we get passed to.  Please get out and vote for Trump on Nov. 8th. Every single vote is so precious and world changing.  It is not only America we are voting for, but also every other country who are greatly affected by the US Government and it's economy among so many other things.  Please vote for me, because I might not be able to.  Peace &amp; Love to all on the Trump Train. #MAGA

I think even Popper was for a two party system. Instead of having many different platforms for different views which will have to create coalitions after the election, you have coalitions of different platforms before the election. Say there are four issues represented by four parties: A, B, C and D. You are pro A and B. You despise D. But A matters most for you.  In a typical parliamentary system you vote for A, then A will create a coalition with one of the other 3. At that point you don't know what will happen.A may create a coalition with D. \n\nIn two party system you see and know the coalition beforehand. If A and D is one party, and B and C another one, you may pick B and C before hand. So that you know D won't be in government even though you are pro A. \n\nLook how Hitler came to power. Check and see how Erdogan became the monopoly (he only got 35 percent of votes in his first election but rest of the vote was too divided). During an instability a strong man, usually gathering one third of votes will gain power. Check out France. Le Pen is more or less the most popular candidate but thanks to a two stage elections which makes it operate like a two party system in second stage, she lost the elections.

However, Reagan was a god damned Movie Star. He was handsome from day one. Fundraising with pictures of him made sense, he was god damned photogenic.\n\nTrump isn't.

Name: tweet_text, dtype: object",*\n\n&gt;*The Arizona Republic endorses Hillary Clinton for president.,"730766    Ground-Breaking &amp; Historic Endorsements/Non-Endorsements compiled:\n\n[**The Chicago Tribune endorses Johnson**](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-gary-johnson-president-endorsement-edit-1002-20160930-story.html) **-** ***2nd Non-Republican endorsement in 163 years***\n\n&gt;*The Republicans have nominated Donald Trump, a man not fit to be president of the United States. We first wrote on March 10 that we would not, could not, endorse him. And in the intervening six-plus months he has splendidly reinforced our verdict: Trump has gone out of his way to anger world leaders, giant swaths of the American public, and people of other lands who aspire to immigrate here legally. He has neither the character nor the prudent disposition for the job.*\n\n&gt;*He has ridden to the White House gate on the backs of Americans who believe they've been robbed of opportunity and respect. But inaugurating a bombastic and self-aggrandizing President Donald Trump isn't the cure.*\n\n&gt;*One party has two moderate Republicans — veteran governors who successfully led Democratic states — atop its ticket. Libertarians Gary Johnson of New Mexico and running mate William Weld of Massachusetts are agile, practical and, unlike the major-party candidates, experienced at managing governments. They offer an agenda that appeals not only to the Tribune's principles but to those of the many Americans who say they are socially tolerant but fiscally responsible.*\n\n&gt;*So the Chicago Tribune today endorses Libertarian Gary Johnson for president of the United States.*\n\n[**The Atlantic endorses Clinton**](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-case-for-hillary-clinton-and-against-donald-trump/501161/) **-** ***Third Presidential endorsement &amp; second non-Republican endorsement in 159 years***\n\n&gt;*We are impressed by many of the qualities of the Democratic Party’s nominee for president, even as we are exasperated by others, but we are mainly concerned with the Republican Party’s nominee, Donald J. Trump, who might be the most ostentatiously unqualified major-party candidate in the 227-year history of the American presidency.*\n\n&gt;*These concerns compel us, for the third time since the magazine’s founding, to endorse a candidate for president. Hillary Rodham Clinton has more than earned, through her service to the country as first lady, as a senator from New York, and as secretary of state, the right to be taken seriously as a White House contender. She has flaws (some legitimately troubling, some exaggerated by her opponents), but she is among the most prepared candidates ever to seek the presidency. We are confident that she understands the role of the United States in the world; we have no doubt that she will apply herself assiduously to the problems confronting this country; and she has demonstrated an aptitude for analysis and hard work.*\n\n&gt;*Donald Trump, on the other hand, has no record of public service and no qualifications for public office. His affect is that of an infomercial huckster; he traffics in conspiracy theories and racist invective; he is appallingly sexist; he is erratic, secretive, and xenophobic; he expresses admiration for authoritarian rulers, and evinces authoritarian tendencies himself. He is easily goaded, a poor quality for someone seeking control of America’s nuclear arsenal. He is an enemy of fact-based discourse; he is ignorant of, and indifferent to, the Constitution; he appears not to read.*\n\n&gt;*In its founding statement, The Atlantic promised that it would be “the organ of no party or clique,” and our interest here is not to advance the prospects of the Democratic Party, nor to damage those of the Republican Party. If Hillary Clinton were facing Mitt Romney, or John McCain, or George W. Bush, or, for that matter, any of the leading candidates Trump vanquished in the Republican primaries, we would not have contemplated making this endorsement. We believe in American democracy, in which individuals from various parties of different ideological stripes can advance their ideas and compete for the affection of voters. But Trump is not a man of ideas. He is a demagogue, a xenophobe, a sexist, a know-nothing, and a liar. He is spectacularly unfit for office, and voters—the statesmen and thinkers of the ballot box—should act in defense of American democracy and elect his opponent.*\n\n[**The San Diego Union-Tribune endorses Clinton**](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/the-conversation/sd-hillary-clinton-endorsement-for-president-20160929-story.html) **-** ***First Democrat endorsed in 148 years***\n\n&gt;*Trump is ""vengeful, dishonest and impulsive"". Terrible leaders can knock nations off course. Venezuela is falling apart because of the obstinance and delusions of Hugo Chávez and his successor. Argentina is finally coming out of the chaos created by Cristina Kirchner and several of her predecessors.*\n\n&gt;*Trump could be our Chávez, our Kirchner. We cannot take that risk.*\n\n&gt;*This paper has not endorsed a Democrat for president in its 148-year history. But we endorse Clinton.*\n\n[**The Detroit News endorses Johnson**](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/09/28/endorse-johnson-president/91254412/) **-** ***First Non-Republican endorsement in 143 years***\n\n&gt;*We abandon that long and estimable tradition this year for one reason: Donald J. Trump.*\n\n&gt;*Trump is not a conservative. Except, of course, of those who wrongly e­quate conservatism with racism, sexism and xenophobia. Trump has attracted support from too many of those who represent the worst of human nature.*\n\n&gt;*We have seen no hint that Trump has a guiding set of principles. He changes positions hour to hour.*\n\n&gt;*But the most worrisome thing about Trump is that he is willing to stir the populace by stoking their fears of sinister forces at work from within and without to tear down their traditions, values and families. He has found profit in dividing Americans from each other, and from the rest of the world.*\n\n&gt;*His sort of populism has led to some of history’s great tragedies.  Donald Trump is unprincipled, unstable and quite possibly dangerous. He can not be president.*\n\n[**The Harvard Republican Club opposes Trump**](https://www.facebook.com/HarvardGOP/posts/1190758900944693) **-** ***First non-endorsement of a Republican in 128 years***\n\n&gt;*Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses –from racist slander to misogynistic taunts– is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.*\n\n&gt;*If enacted, Donald Trump’s platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad.*\n\n&gt;*Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world.*\n\n&gt;*Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children.*\n\n&gt;*We call on our party’s elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man.*\n\n[**The Arizona Republic endorses Clinton**](http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/09/27/hillary-clinton-endorsement/91198668/) **-** ***First Democrat endorsed in 126 years***\n\n&gt;*Trump’s inability to control himself or be controlled by others represents a real threat to our national security. \nThe president commands our nuclear arsenal. Trump can’t command his own rhetoric.*\n\n&gt;*Were he to become president, his casual remarks — such as saying he wouldn’t defend NATO partners from invasion — could have devastating consequences.  In a global economy, he offers protectionism and a false promise to bring back jobs that no longer exist.*\n\n&gt;*Trump’s long history of objectifying women and his demeaning comments about women during the campaign are not just good-old-boy gaffes. They are evidence of deep character flaws. They are part of a pattern.*\n\n&gt;*Trump mocked a reporter’s physical handicap. Picked a fight with a Gold Star family. Insulted POWs. Suggested a Latino judge can’t be fair because of his heritage. Proposed banning Muslim immigration.*\n\n&gt;*Each of those comments show a stunning lack of human decency, empathy and respect. Taken together they reveal a candidate who doesn’t grasp our national ideals.*\n\n&gt;*The Arizona Republic endorses Hillary Clinton for president.*

I'm new to this, so go easy on the criticism.\n\n""You must die.""\n\n""But..."" his exasperation turned to morbid curiosity. ""Why me? You set my brother free...""\n\n""I made it my goal to kill every person from Gordonsville who regularly goes by their 3-syllable name.""\n\nDamnit, Grey Witch. Yes, it's technically true, but I thought I explained it with an interesting backstory.\n\nShe went on about the robbery, her enslavement, her winning the lottery and finally being able to amass the weapons for her partial revenge--\n\n""Wait what? You won the lottery. You could have ran away and arrested them overseas, where they have smartphones, internet, and probably caught those psychos' next crime on surveillance. And you don't need to use maces, and caves for dungeons."" Stop it Johnathon\n\n""That wouldn't be as dramatic, apparently.""\n\n""So what does this all have to do with 3-syllable names.""\n\n""I forgot. Wanna visit America?"" Please this is NOT WHAT I WANTED WHEN I WROTE A FANTASY ON AN ISLAND SET IN THE MODERN WORLD. Also I forgot to give the good guy access to laser guns. Shit.\n\n""Sure, will you set everyone else free?""\n\nThe Grey Witch vehemently spat ""I think we should all come to a complete agreement first. I'll serve ya'll your first real meal in a while tonight.""\n\nWell. Crap. The only place this story can go now is in response to some really weird writing prompt.

It's a purposeful and standard part of taxes. Not all business operate on a yearly cycle and lots and lots of business (and medical, technological, intellectual, etc.) developments would be greatly hindered if we pretended like they did. \n\nPeople just like to hate Trump, which is understandable. But it's sad that people express blind hatred at the expense of their own critical thinking and understanding of the world they live in.
